### Good screen compatibility

But it is strongly recommend that you play in windowed mode for the best experience.
A custom resolution is also supported.

This background music can be disabled in the settings.

### Sound effects support

These soundeffect can also be disabled in the settings.

### A database to save your progress

When registering a new user, you will get a set amount of playchances. After winning a game you will increase the playchances. Watch out thou that you do not run out of them.

### Short gamemode
